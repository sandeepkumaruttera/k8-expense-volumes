# Sure! Here's a clearer explanation:

# In Kubernetes, volumeMount is used to attach storage (called a Volume) to a container inside a pod.

# Why we use it:
# Containers lose data when they stop or restart — they are temporary.

# A Volume keeps data safe outside the container, even if the container crashes.

# volumeMount tells where inside the container the volume should appear (like /app/data).

# This lets containers share files, save logs, configs, or persistent data across restarts or between pods.

# Think of it like connecting an external hard drive to a laptop — so the data stays safe even if the laptop restarts.
